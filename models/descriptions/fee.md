{% docs fee %}

The transaction fee (FLOAT, BTC) paid by this transaction, calculated as the difference between the sum of input values and the sum of output values. In Bitcoin's UTXO model, transaction fees are the primary incentive for miners to include transactions in blocks. Higher fees increase the likelihood of faster confirmation as miners prioritize transactions with better fee-to-size ratios. Fees are essential for network security and help prevent spam transactions. The fee market is dynamic and responds to network congestion and blockspace demand.

Example: 0.00004567
